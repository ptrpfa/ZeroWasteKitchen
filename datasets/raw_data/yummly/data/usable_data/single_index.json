		"Marinate the seafood in a big bowl with half the wine, half the coconut milk, a good dash of olive oil, the salt and the bouquet guarni, for about 30 minutes tops. When removing, remove all the liquid. Cut the fish in chunks. Shell and devein the scampi_ you can do this by gripping its body on one hand and twisting the head off with the other_ but you may separate some entire for decoration; which will also provide a more flavorful dish. Then turn the scampi over, pull the shell open (lengthwise along its belly); working from the head end downwards; prise it open and pull the prawn free. Leave the very end of the shell on. To devein it, check for a black line down the back of it, and carefully remove it with a toothpick or a small, sharp knife. You will actually leave the tail on (which is called to butterfly a prawn or scampi). Then make a deep cut along its belly, open it outwards and press it down, to release the flavors. This latter technique can be done right before serving, or as you prefer. In a pan, bring the water to a quick boil (equivalent of two fingers of height of liquid), add the mussels, pepper and lemon juice. Turn off the heat right after that; let them on the hot stovetop until they open up the shells. Once they do, remove immediately from any heat or water and reserve, with the shells wide opened. In a big sauce pan, sauté the fish (moderate heat) in two tbsp of olive oil for 3 minutes the first side, then flip and add the calamari rings on top; but remove from heat in 2 minutes. Reserve away from all heat, along with the mussels. In the same pan with the same oil, quickly sauté the scampi for 2 minutes. All of these delicate seafood cannot be overcooked; so consider that you add them to the steamy hot rice in the end; adding another 2 minutes in the hot rice will finish cooking them to perfection, without getting mushy. In a big paella pan, sauté the remaining olive oil with the whole cloves of garlic and the rosemary and let them aromatize it. Before burning, remove them. Keep the moderate heat; and add the crushed garlic. When it’s about to brown, add the rice and ‘fry’ it for a couple of minutes_ So as not to let the garlic get bitter, don’t let it get brown. Add the clam stock, saffron flowers, paprika, turmeric, salt, chipotle and tomato purée, and give it a stir. Cook preferably in low to moderate heat. Keep a lid on top and open on 5 minutes; or if not using a lid, just keep an eye on it. Add half the coconut milk and part of the wine. Let it finish cooking and 5 minutes later you should check again; to see if the rice is almost al dente and if it needs additional liquid. If it does, add a bit of water and the remaining wine, but solely the necessary. Add the fish. Sprinkle the chopped parsley. If the rice is al dente, you may turn off the heat and add the remaining seafood, even the ones for decoration, so they will also absorb the moisture. Also add the olives. Stir it a little bit and bring the serving platter next to the stove. Delicately place the paella on the platter, using the most beautiful scampi for decorating the borders. Also sprinkle the mondego cheese on top and serve. Carol Witherspoon"

Depending on the strength of your food processor, this could take a good 3-4 minutes, stopping to scrape the sides down every so often. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and add in the chicken breast. Turn the chicken, spooning the yogurt over each breast, until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Once marinated, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Place the chicken into the prepared baking dish. Also, place the cherry tomatoes onto a small baking sheet and spray with cooking spray. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink inside, and the tomatoes are soft and roasted, about 20-25 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese on top of the chicken and bake for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until the cheese melts. While the chicken bakes, use the 5mm blade on your spiralizer to turn the zucchini into noodles. Place the zucchini noodles into a large strainer, set over a large bowl, and toss with a little bit of salt. Let sit, stirring occasionally, as the chicken cooks. Squeeze out as much excess moisture from the zucchini noodles as you can and toss them a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and a pinch of pepper. Add in the roasted tomatoes and lightly toss. Divide the mixture between 4 plates and place a piece of chicken on top. Divide the fresh basil between the bowls and DEVOUR."

Mix and knead together all of the dough ingredients, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, till you've created a soft, smooth dough., Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours; this will heighten the crust's flavor., Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and divide it in half., Lightly grease two 12\" to 14\" round pizza pans; or a couple of baking sheets; or a couple of pieces of parchment (if you're going to bake on a stone)., Shape each piece of dough into a 10\" to 14\" disk (thick crust vs. thin crust), and place in the prepared pans., Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 to 2 hours, till the crust is as puffy as you like. While the crust is rising, prepare the filling. And, towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F., Lightly grease a frying pan or skillet, and sauté the pineapple till lightly browned. Remove the pineapple, and sauté the ham. While this step isn't strictly necessary, it intensifies the flavors, and helps keep the pizza from getting soggy from pineapple juice., To prepare the pizzas: Bake the pizza crusts, without toppings, for about 12 minutes, till they're set but not browned., Remove from the oven, and spread with tomato sauce. Layer with the pineapple and ham, then sprinkle with cheese., Return pizzas to the oven, and bake for an additional 12 to 16 minutes, till the crusts are brown and the cheese is melted and barely beginning to brown., Remove from the oven, and transfer to a rack. Slice and serve ASAP., Yield: 2 pizzas, about 16 slices."

Add vegetables and continue to braise for 2-3 minutes. Turn skillet to 250 degrees. Add beer, water, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and worcestershire sauce, over steaks evenly. Cover and simmer, turning steaks and stirring vegetables every now and then, for about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Keep covered. Remove steaks and vegetables. (Optional-mix cornstarch and COLD water. Add to broth and make a thin \"gravy like\" consistency. Serve over steaks and vegetables.) The consistency of the \"gravy\" is thicker then the broth, but thinner then a gravy. Add move cornstarch/water mix, if you want it thicker. Serve over the steak and vegetables. I always make mashed potatoes and vegetable with this and serve the gravy over the potatoes. ENJOY!"

		"In a soup pot over medium heat, add the water, onion, garlic, yams, salt, coriander seeds, and red pepper flakes. Cover and let cook for 5-7 minutes. While cooking, prepare the lemongrass. Cut off the lower yellow bulbous portion (about halfway), and remove the outer tough leaves (discard outer leaves along with upper portion of stalk). Using your chef’s knife ‘bruise’ this bulbous portion. Cut a few shallow slits in the stalk and then use pressure on your knife to open and bruise the stalk, to help release its flavors (do not chop the stalk, keep in one piece). Add the lemongrass, zucchini, bell pepper, stock, water, coconut milk, peanut butter (start with ½ cup + 1 tbsp), tamari, and fresh ginger. Stir through and increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce heat to low/medium-low, cover, and let simmer for 10 minutes. After this time, add the tofu (see note) and gently stir through. Simmer covered for another 3-5 minutes, or longer until yams have completely softened and can be easily squished. Add the fresh spinach and lime juice (start with 2½ tbsp, and add more if desired), stir through and serve immediately (so spinach stays a vibrant green color). Taste, and if you’d like a full peanut flavor, add the remaining 1 tbsp of peanut butter, or more if desired. Remove piece of lemongrass before serving. Serve garnished with fresh cilantro if desired, and with a lime wedge to squeeze juices on individual portions. Serves 4-5."

	"recipe": [
		" Remove the rack of lamb from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to cook it; bring to room temperature. Use a sharp knife to score the fat cap on the top of the rack, which will help it form a crispy crust. Season the meat with sea salt and pepper on all sides. When the lamb has been out for about 40 minutes, preheat the oven to 450°F. In a small bowl, mix the butter and crème fraîche with 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt and a few generous grinds of pepper. Rub a little bit of the butter and crème fraîche mixture onto the bottom and sides of the rack, and slather the rest of it onto the top. Place the rack in a large cast iron skillet. Roast lamb for 15 minutes; reduce heat to 400°F and roast for 10 more minutes for medium rare or 15 more minutes for medium, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center reads 130° for medium rare or 135° for medium. Transfer the lamb to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, in a small saucepan, heat blueberries, chopped shallot, lemon juice, and salt in small saucepan with a teaspoon of water. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about ten minutes, or until most of the blueberries have popped and the liquid around them is syrupy. Let cool for at least ten minutes, and then transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Add the crème fraîche, honey and mustard; process again. Add hot water and puree until combined. Return the sauce to the pan and cover to keep warm. Use a carving knife to slice the rack into 6 servings. It’s easiest to start by standing the rack up and holding onto the two bones at one end with your non-­dominant hand. Using the other hand, slice down between the second and third bones with a few quick, sweeping strokes. Repeat the same method for the other pieces. To serve, spoon about 2 tablespoons of sauce onto each plate; sprinkle with thyme. Top with the lamb, dragging the meat from the center of the dollop of sauce outward to create a festive swirl if desired. "

Replace foil and put the dish back in the oven. Bake for another 30-35mins. Finally remove the dish from the oven and discard the foil.
